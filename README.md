# Project Overview 
A Java application that enables the user to encrypt and decrypt images.  

The user can select an image, from the local storage, along with a key that the user needs to pass manually. This key will then be used to encrypt the image. The same key will also be needed for decrypting the image.

The application is built in Java and Java Swing Framework for UI.
